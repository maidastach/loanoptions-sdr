# Task 1 - API - React

Description

Built a single Page React application which fetches information from an API and displays
the results on a table.

Live URL:
https://loanoptions-sdr.vercel.app/

Instructions

    ● When the page loads, the table is empty.

    ● Based on the API information, I structured the table columns and naming

    ● Added three floating buttons, ‘LOAD’ (blue) , ‘DELETE’ (red) and ‘ADD’ (green)

    ● When ‘LOAD’ is clicked, fetch the information and display the results on the table

    ● ‘LOAD’ disappear as soon as the data is fetched

    ● Pagination and Sticky Scrolling for better experience reading the data

    ● When ‘DELETE’ is clicked, remove the last item of the table if data is loaded otherwise shows an error

    ● When ‘ADD’ is clicked, if data is loaded insert the ﬁrst item of the table to the last (ﬁrst itemshould remain as it is ) otherwise throws an error

    ● Delays on 'ADD' and 'DELETE' actions to simulate REST API

    ● I could have displayed conditionally 'ADD' and 'DELETE' buttons if data is on screen, however i left them to demonstrate the handling of error messages in the UI

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
